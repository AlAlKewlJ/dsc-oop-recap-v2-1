Like functions, using classes in your programming can save you a lot of time by eliminating repetitive tasks. Classes go further than functions by allowing you to persist data. After all, class methods are fairly analogous to functions, while attributes add additional functionality by acting as data storage containers.\n", "\n", "## Class Structure\n", "\n", "As you saw, the most basic class definition starts off with:  \n", "\n", "```python\n", "class Class_name:\n", "```\n", "\n", "From there, you then saw how you can further define methods to the class:  \n", "\n", "```python\n", "class Class_name:\n", "    def method1(self):\n", "        pass # Ideally a method does something, but you get the point\n", "    def method2(self):\n", "        print('This is a pretty useless second method.')\n", "```\n", "\n", "You also learned about `self`. Specifically, that `self` is the default parameter used to define methods. This is necessary since instance methods implicitly pass in the object itself as an argument during execution.\n", "\n", "## Creating Instances\n", "\n", "Recall that once you define a class, you can then create instances of that class to bring it to life and use it!\n", "\n", "For example, you might import the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn in order to create a regression model!\n", "\n", "Remember, creating an instance of a class would look like this:\n", "\n", "```python\n", "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression() # Importing our class definition\n", "reg = LinearRegression() # Creating an instance of the class\n", "```\n", "\n", "Once you create an instance object of the class, you can then use all the methods associated with that class!\n", "\n", "## Level Up\n", "\n", "If you would like to dive deeper into OOP and learn some advanced topics, you can check out the additional OOP lessons and labs in the Appendix.\n", "\n", "## Summary\n", "\n", "Congrats! You now have a solid foundation in OOP which will be useful for collaboration and writing concise modular code!"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
